# AQI-Level-Power-BI-Dashboard
## Project Overview

The AQI Level Power BI Dashboard is an interactive data visualization project designed to analyze and monitor Air Quality Index (AQI) levels across different regions and time periods. The dashboard helps users quickly understand air pollution patterns, compare AQI levels, and identify areas with critical air quality conditions.

This project is suitable for environmental analysis, public awareness, and data visualization demonstrations using Microsoft Power BI.

## Objectives

- Analyze air quality trends using AQI data

- Compare AQI levels across locations

- Identify pollution severity categories (Good, Moderate, Poor, etc.)

- Present insights through an interactive and user-friendly dashboard

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project contains air quality–related information such as:

- AQI values

- Location (State/City)

- Date or time period

- AQI category levels

Note: The dataset is imported and processed directly within the Power BI file.

## Dashboard Features

- KPI Cards showing key AQI metrics

- Line / Bar Charts to visualize AQI trends

- Donut / Pie Charts for AQI category distribution

- Slicers for filtering by location and time

- Interactive visuals for better data exploration

- Clean and consistent theme for readability

## Tools & Technologies Used

- Microsoft Power BI

- Power Query for data cleaning and transformation

- DAX for calculated measures

## How to Use the Dashboard

1. Download or clone this repository

2. Open the file AQI Level.pbix using Microsoft Power BI Desktop

3. Use slicers to filter data by region or time
   
4. Interact with visuals to explore AQI insights

## Key Insights

- Helps identify regions with high pollution levels

- Enables comparison of air quality across different areas

- Useful for understanding AQI trends over time

## Future Enhancements

- Add real-time AQI data integration

- Include more geographical drill-down (map visual)

- Add forecasting for AQI levels
